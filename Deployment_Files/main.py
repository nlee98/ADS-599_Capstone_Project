    This application has two modes: _URL Mode_ and _Manual Mode_. We recommend trying _URL Mode_ first.
         
            
    - In _URL Mode_, you can simply copy and paste the URL of an Airbnb listing of interest, enter the listed price,
    and click _Price Prediction_ to get a price estimate.
    
            
    - In _Manual Mode_, you can manually enter data regarding the property and host to get a price estimate.
    
    For info about the creators, models, and code, please visit the _About_ section.
